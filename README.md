This is a project that I worked on for while at Prime Digital Academy.

This single page web application will let you log in to your Twitter Account, then create a place on a mongo database, where you will then be able to save tweets and articles for later viewing.

The app is set up to look for relevant Advertising news related tweets and articles, only when they have been retweeted over a certain threshold.

Using the twitter API and OAuth to keep accounts secured was I able to complete this project.

The overall project is a MEAN stack application, and all styling and design were done by my with no frameworks. Unfortunately this was before I dove into Sass compiling, so the CSS could be refactored for legibility and modularized for maintainability.
